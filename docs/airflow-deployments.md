If you're just getting started on Astronomer, you'll want to have a solid grasp on common terminology specific to both Apache Airflow and our platform. In this guide, you'll find some general definitions to start followed by a more in-depth breakdown.

### Basic Definitions

**Astronomer Workspace** = A personal or shared space on Astronomerâ€™s platform that is home to a collection of Airflow deployments. User access to deployments is managed at the workspace level on Astronomer.

**Airflow Deployment** = A single instance of Apache Airflow made up of a scheduler, a webserver, and one or more workers. A deployment has the capacity to host a collection of DAGs, and sits on top of a corresponding Kubernetes cluster.

### Workspace Layer

A `Workspace` is an Astronomer-specific term. You can think of your workspaces the same way you'd think of teams - they're just collections of Airflow deployments that specific user groups have access to. When you create an account on Astronomer, a default personal workspace is automatically created. Airflow deployments are hierarchically lower - from a workspace, you can create one or more Airflow deployments, and grant or restrict user access to those deployments accordingly.

If you were a solo agent, you could have multiple Airflow deployments within that single workspace and have no need for additional workspaces. Teams, however, often share one or more workspaces labeled as such, and have multiple Airflow deployments from there. To invite a team member, they first have to create their own account here before they can be invited to an additional or shared workspace.


Within your Astronomer Workspace, you can create one or more Airflow deployments. Under the hood, each deployment gets its own Kubernetes namespace and has a set isolated resources reserved for itself.

### Deployment Layer

In the context of Astronomer, the term `Airflow Deployment` is used to describe an instance of Airflow that you've spun up either via our [app UI](https://astronomer.io/docs/overview) or [CLI](https://astronomer.io/docs/cli-getting-started).

For Cloud customers, that cluster is hosted on Astronomer. For Enterprise customers, that cluster is hosted on your own Kubernetes.




You will soon be able to control specific resource allocations and choose your executor (local or celery) directly from our app's UI. This functionality will allow you to easily provision additional resources for specific Airflow deployments as you scale up.
