## Cloud Pricing

Astronomer Cloud is priced based on number Airflow deployments you use and the resources you allocate to each cluster. It is fully managed and allows you to run as many DAGs as you'd like. Resources are isolated within each Airflow deployment, and you can scale up and down resource allocation via the sliders in our UI.

## Enterprise Pricing

Astronomer Enterprise is priced via an annual licensing fee. You get access to the entire source code that powers Astronomer and pay us a flat fee for unlimited workers and Airflow deployments on your Kubernetes cluster.
